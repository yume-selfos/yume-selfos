        <h2>What is SelfOS?</h2>
        <p><strong>SelfOS is not a tool for productivity.</strong> It's a sanctuary for your inner life—a space free from metrics, deadlines, or external validation.</p>
        <p>Think of it as your personal reflection system: a way to capture your voice, your thoughts, your dreams, and your evolving self. It's where you preserve the story of your life—not just what you did, but how you felt, what you believed, and who you were becoming.</p>

        <h2>Why SelfOS?</h2>
        <p>We’re surrounded by software that nudges us to hustle harder. SelfOS invites you to pause.</p>
        <p>This isn’t a productivity suite. It’s an <strong>inner operating system</strong>—a quiet space to notice, reflect, and reconnect with what truly matters.</p>
        <p>Instead of optimizing output, you’ll record meaning. Instead of tracking progress, you’ll preserve perspective. SelfOS helps you stay rooted in your values, even in a world that rushes past them.</p>

    <section class="how-selfos-works">
        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <h3>SelfOS grows with you, every step of the way:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Capture your voice:</strong> Speak freely throughout your day. Your voice is your fingerprint—and now, your archive.</li>
            <li><strong>Track key memories:</strong> Journal your experiences in writing, voice, or video. Preserve not just what happened, but how it shaped you.</li>
            <li><strong>Look inward, with guidance:</strong> SelfOS offers prompts and insights to help you understand your motivations, patterns, and dreams.</li>
            <li><strong>Evolve over time:</strong> As you grow, so does your SelfOS. It mirrors your path, helping you reflect, recalibrate, and remember.</li>
        </ul>
